# OOP_Project
We are creating a Broadway show ticket roulette where you let the computer choose your ticket fate. We will be using Java and SQL. 


Idea: Broadway Show Roulette
Description:
In this OOP project, we'll design a Broadway show roulette application. Users, as customers, can select three out of five Broadway shows. After making their choices, they proceed to payment. Once paid, they click 'Find your Show,' and the application randomly selects one of their chosen shows. Users can also download their 'tickets' for convenience.

User Interaction:
Upon entering the application, users are greeted with the main window (main GUI), featuring two key buttons: "Descriptions" and "Start Buy."

Show Descriptions:
Clicking the "Descriptions" button opens a new window page (new GUI) providing detailed show information. This includes the show's name, regular ticket cost, show description, and schedule details. Users can easily navigate back to the main screen or exit the application at their convenience.

Start Buying Process:
Opting for the "Start Buy" button initiates a new window (new GUI) where users can select their top three preferred Broadway shows. Clicking "Next" progresses them to the payment page, displaying a secure and straightforward payment interface.

Payment Process:
The payment page exclusively accepts customer’s information and "card" information, detailing the total amount due ($46). Users are prompted to enter Name on Card, Billing Address, 3-number CVV, and a 6-letter card number. Any inaccuracies will not allow the user to click the button and advance to the next screen. A message will appear saying to recheck the input. Upon successful entry, clicking "Pay" advances users to the next stage. 

Final Page and View Ticket:
After purchasing the ticket(s), there will be a screen revealing the chosen show and displaying confirmation of ticket purchase. There will be a message saying, “Congratulations! You are seeing a broadway show!” and below it, a confirmation number, payment method, location of show, and day/time of show will be displayed.  There will also be two buttons on this page, “View Ticket” and “Sell Ticket,” where “View Ticket” will take the user to a screen showing something similar to their ticket (Name, ticket show name, date, time, and location of the show) and a QR code to be scanned at the theater. 

Sell Ticket:
If the user selects “Sell Ticket, ” the user will be able to sell their ticket if they no longer are able to attend the show. At the top of the “Sell Ticket” screen, there will be the name/date/time of the show they are selling the ticket for. There will be a field to complete which allows the user to set the price they want to sell their ticket for and based on the ticket price they list, there will be a message displayed saying, “You increased your ticket price by ___ %.” At the bottom, there will be two buttons, “Cancel” and “Confirm”; the “Cancel” button will take the user back to the ticket confirmation screen and the “Confirm” button will confirm the user wants to sell the ticket and take them to another confirmation page with those associated details - “You listed your ticket to be sold for ___” with the show name and “You have 30 days to sell your ticket, otherwise your ticket will not be refunded.” 

Conclusion:
In summary, our Broadway show roulette application combines user choice, detailed show descriptions, and a secure payment process to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for customers. By seamlessly integrating entertainment and technology, we aim to deliver a memorable journey through the world of Broadway shows.
