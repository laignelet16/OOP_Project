# OOP_Project
We are creating a Broadway show ticket roulette where you let the computer choose your ticket fate. We will be using Java and SQL. 


**Idea**: Broadway Show Roulette
Description:
In this OOP project, we'll design a Broadway show roulette application. Users, as customers, can select three out of five Broadway shows. After making their choices, they proceed to payment. Once paid, they click 'Buy Ticket' and the application randomly selects one of their chosen shows. Users will see their ticket and show and will have the option to resale their ticket.

**Conclusion**:
In summary, our Broadway show roulette application combines user choice, detailed show descriptions, and a secure payment process to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for customers. By seamlessly integrating entertainment and technology, we aim to deliver a memorable journey through the world of Broadway shows.
